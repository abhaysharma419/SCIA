Schema Change Impact Agent (SCIA)
Predict downstream impact of SQL schema changes before they break production.

Schema Change Impact Agent (SCIA) is a SQL‑first, open‑source agent that analyzes schema changes before deployment and tells you what will break, how risky it is, and why — using only existing warehouse metadata and SQL definitions.

No catalog required.
No vendor lock‑in.
No mandatory frameworks.

Why SCIA Exists
Every data platform already has:

SQL tables, views, and procedures

Warehouse metadata (information_schema)

Query history

Yet schema changes still:

Break downstream views

Corrupt metrics silently

Cause late‑night rollbacks

The problem is not missing metadata.
The problem is no automated reasoning over SQL and dependencies.

SCIA fills that gap.

What SCIA Does
Given a proposed SQL schema change, SCIA:

Detects breaking changes

Resolves downstream dependencies

Identifies grain and join risk

Scores deployment risk

Explains the impact in plain English

All before the change reaches production.

What SCIA Does Not Do
❌ No metadata catalog

❌ No data ingestion

❌ No enforcement (yet)

❌ No dashboards

❌ No vendor‑specific lock‑in

SCIA is intentionally small, composable, and read‑only.

SQL‑First by Design
SCIA is built around universal primitives:

Input	Required
SQL DDL / model changes	✅
Warehouse metadata (information_schema)	✅
View / table definitions	✅
Query history (optional)	⭕
DBT is optional, not required.

If DBT artifacts are present, SCIA uses them to enrich lineage and semantics.
If not, SCIA works entirely from SQL and warehouse metadata.

How It Works (High Level)
Reads proposed SQL/schema changes

Extracts warehouse metadata (read‑only)

Resolves downstream dependencies

Analyzes structural and semantic risk

Generates a human‑readable impact report

Supported Warehouses (v0.1)
Snowflake ✅

BigQuery (planned)

Databricks (planned)

Installation
pip install scia
Usage
CLI (SQL‑only)
scia analyze \
  --warehouse snowflake \
  --database analytics \
  --schema mart \
  --changed-object orders
SQL Diff / File‑based Analysis
scia analyze \
  --warehouse snowflake \
  --sql-diff schema_changes.sql
Optional: DBT Enrichment
If DBT artifacts are available, provide them optionally:

scia analyze \
  --warehouse snowflake \
  --sql-diff schema_changes.sql \
  --dbt-manifest manifest.json \
  --dbt-catalog catalog.json
DBT improves confidence — it is never required.

Example Output
RISK: HIGH

• Column `customer_id` removed
• 3 downstream views depend on this column
• Revenue aggregation grain may change
• Historical queries rely on this field

Recommendation:
Update dependent views before deployment.
Outputs are available as:

Markdown (humans)

JSON (machines)

What Counts as a Schema Change
SCIA currently analyzes:

Column removal

Column rename (heuristic)

Data type change

Nullability change

Join key change

Grain change (heuristic)

These represent the majority of real‑world data incidents.

Risk Scoring Model
Each change is scored as:

LOW – Safe change

MEDIUM – Review recommended

HIGH – Likely to break downstream systems

Scores are based on:

Change type

Dependency depth

Query usage patterns

Semantic indicators (if available)

Design Principles
SQL‑first

Warehouse‑native

Read‑only

Deterministic logic first

LLMs explain, not decide

CLI & CI over UI

Composable agents, not platforms

Roadmap
v0.1 (Current)
SQL‑first analysis

Snowflake metadata

CLI interface

Markdown & JSON reports

v0.2
Query history‑aware impact

Improved rename detection

CI / PR comments

v0.3
Risk thresholds & policies

Slack notifications

Historical incident learning

Who This Is For
Data Engineers

Platform Teams

Warehouse‑centric organizations

SQL‑heavy environments

Teams without DBT (and with DBT)

Why Open Source
SCIA is open source because:

Schema reasoning should be transparent

Metadata should not be locked in

Governance should integrate with SQL workflows

Future paid extensions (optional) may include:

Audit trails

Compliance reporting

Enterprise integrations

The core agent will remain open.
